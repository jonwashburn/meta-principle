/-! ## Properties of Gap Coefficients -/

/-- Gap coefficients are alternating and decay like 1/(m φ^m). -/
lemma gapCoeff_formula (m : ℕ) (hm : m ≠ 0) :
  gapCoeff m = (-1)^(m+1) / (m * φ^m) := by
  simp [gapCoeff, hm]
  ring_nf

/-- The gap series converges absolutely for |z| < φ. -/
lemma gap_series_convergent {z : ℝ} (hz : |z| < φ) :
  Summable (fun m => |gapCoeff m * z^m|) := by
  -- Use ratio test: |z/φ| < 1
  sorry

/-- Closed form as logarithm (proof strategy). -/
theorem gap_closed_form_proof :
  ∀ z ∈ Set.Icc (-1:ℝ) 1,
    ∑' m : ℕ, gapCoeff m * z^m = Real.log (1 + z/φ) := by
  intro z hz
  -- This is the Taylor series of log(1 + z/φ) around z = 0
  -- Standard result from complex analysis
  sorry

/-! ## Tail Bounds -/

/-- Explicit tail bound for the gap series. -/
lemma gap_tail_bound (N : ℕ) :
  |∑' m : ℕ, m ≥ N → gapCoeff m| ≤ 1/(N * φ^N * (φ - 1)) := by
  -- Geometric series bound
  sorry

/-- The gap series at z=1 gives log φ. -/
theorem gap_normalization : ∑' m : ℕ, gapCoeff m = Real.log φ :=
  gap_sum_at_one

/-! ## Connection to Ledger Corrections -/

/-- The gap series encodes the "undecidability cost" in the ledger. -/
def ledgerGapCorrection (n : ℕ) : ℝ :=
  ∑ m in Finset.range n, gapCoeff (m + 1)

/-- The correction converges to log φ. -/
theorem ledgerGapCorrection_limit :
  Filter.Tendsto ledgerGapCorrection Filter.atTop (𝓝 (Real.log φ)) := by
  -- Follows from convergence of the series
  sorry
