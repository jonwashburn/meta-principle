Lattice–independent eight–tick (2^d) lower bound, fully self–contained.

Drop-in file for the repo, no `sorry` and no external dependencies beyond Mathlib.

Results:

- `no_surj_small`              : no surjection `Fin T → (Fin d → Bool)` if `T < 2^d`.
- `min_ticks_cover`            : any pass that hits all `2^d` patterns has length ≥ `2^d`.
- `min_ticks_cover_states`     : same bound after a parity map from arbitrary states.
- `eight_tick_min`             : specialization `d = 3` gives the 8–tick bound.

Interpretation in RS:
`(Fin d → Bool)` plays the role of d independent binary parities/ports.
A recognition pass that covers all parities must visit at least `2^d` distinct parity
classes, hence at least `2^d` ticks — regardless of geometry, mesh, or lattice.
