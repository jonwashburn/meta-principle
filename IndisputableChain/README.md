# IndisputableChain (archived)

This directory is an older snapshot. The current, sorry‑free Lean core is maintained in the monolith file at the repo root:

- IndisputableMonolith.lean (T1–T8, ClassicalBridge T4 gauge classes, ConeBound BFS equivalence)

Please use the monolith for all new work and citations. This folder remains for historical reference and will not receive updates.
