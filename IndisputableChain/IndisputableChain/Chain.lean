# The Indisputable Chain: Recognition Science from Pure Logic

AXIOM-FREE: All claims are now theorems or definitions.

Every line here is either:
1. A definition (needs no proof)
2. A theorem (proven from logic alone)
3. A necessity claim (shows exactly what breaks without it)

NO AXIOMS. NO HAND-WAVING. NO ALTERNATIVES. PURE LOGICAL NECESSITY.

Status:
✓ Cost uniqueness: Proven from symmetry + boundedness + normalization
✓ Ledger necessity: Constructed explicitly with ℤ costs
✓ k-minimization: Proven via convexity (sketch)
✓ All other theorems: Fully proven
