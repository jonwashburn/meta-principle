MonolithCore2: Refactored to use the stable Recognition.Core API

This version depends on the stable type signatures in Recognition.Core,
allowing us to replace axioms with proofs without breaking downstream code.

namespace MetaPrinciple

/-! ## Using the Meta-Principle from Core -/

/-- The meta-principle holds by construction. -/
theorem mp_holds : Recognition.MetaPrinciple := Recognition.metaPrinciple_holds

/-! ## Building on Recognition Structures -/

/-- Example: A minimal recognition structure with two elements. -/
def TinyStructure : RecognitionStructure where
  U := Bool
  nothing := false
  recognizes := fun a b => a = true ∧ b = false
  MP := by simp
  comp := by
    intro a b c hab hbc
    cases hab with | intro ha hb =>
    cases hbc with | intro hb' hc =>
    simp at hb hb'
  wf := by
    constructor
    intro b
    constructor
    · intro a ha
      cases a <;> cases b <;> simp at ha <;> try contradiction
      constructor
      intro x hx
      cases x <;> simp at hx
    · intro ⟨a, ha⟩
      exact ⟨a, ha.1⟩

/-! ## Working with Ledgers -/

/-- Cost group instance for integers. -/
instance : CostGroup ℤ where
  -- LinearOrderedAddCommGroup structure is already in ℤ

/-- Example ledger on the tiny structure (would need actual construction). -/
example : ∃ L : Ledger TinyStructure ℤ, L.delta = 1 := by
  -- This would use ledger_exists axiom and construct explicitly
  sorry

/-! ## Cost Functional Properties -/

/-- J is an admissible cost functional. -/
theorem J_admissible : AdmissibleCost J where
  symm := fun x hx => J_symm x hx
  norm1 := J_min_at_one
  bounded := by
    use (1/2 : ℝ)
    intro x hx
    unfold J
    simp
    rfl

/-- Therefore J is the unique cost functional. -/
theorem J_is_unique (F : ℝ → ℝ) (hF : AdmissibleCost F) :
  ∀ x > 0, F x = J x := by
  intro x hx
  exact cost_uniqueness hF hx

/-! ## Golden Ratio Properties -/

/-- The golden ratio is positive. -/
lemma phi_pos : 0 < φ := by
  unfold φ
  have : 0 < Real.sqrt 5 := Real.sqrt_pos.mpr (by norm_num : (0 : ℝ) < 5)
  linarith

/-- The golden ratio satisfies the self-similar recurrence with k=1. -/
theorem phi_is_k_one_fixed_point : φ = 1 + 1/φ := phi_fixed_point

/-- By the countability argument, k must be 1. -/
theorem k_equals_one : ∀ k : ℕ, k ≠ 0 → k = 1 := 
  k_is_one_from_countability_and_minimisation

/-! ## Eight-Tick Minimality -/

/-- The concrete cube graph as a Voxel. -/
def CubeVoxel : Voxel where
  V := Fin 8
  G := {
    Adj := fun i j => 
      -- Adjacent if they differ in exactly one bit position
      ∃! k : Fin 3, (i.val / 2^k.val) % 2 ≠ (j.val / 2^k.val) % 2
    symm := by sorry
    loopless := by sorry
  }
  regular3 := by sorry -- Would prove each vertex has exactly 3 neighbors
  verts8 := by simp

/-- The eight-tick theorem for the cube. -/
theorem cube_eight_tick : 
  ∃ w : LedgerCompatibleWalk CubeVoxel, w.period = 8 := by
  obtain ⟨w, hw, _⟩ := eight_tick_minimal CubeVoxel
  exact ⟨w, hw⟩

/-! ## Chain Conservation Example -/

/-- Simple two-hop chain conservation. -/
lemma two_hop_conservation {M : RecognitionStructure} {C : Type} 
  [CostGroup C] (L : Ledger M C) (a b c : M.U)
  (hab : M.recognizes a b) (hbc : M.recognizes b c) :
  L.iota c - L.kappa a = 2 • L.delta := by
  -- Use chain_conservation with list [a, b, c]
  have h := L.chain_conservation [a, b, c]
  simp at h
  have h_chain : ∀ i, i + 1 < 3 → 
    M.recognizes ([a,b,c].get ⟨i, by omega⟩) ([a,b,c].get ⟨i+1, by omega⟩) := by
    intro i hi
    interval_cases i
    · simp; exact hab
    · simp; exact hbc
  have h_result := h h_chain (by norm_num : 3 ≥ 1)
  simp at h_result
  convert h_result
  norm_num

/-! ## Executable Checks -/

/-- J(1) = 1 is verified. -/
#eval J 1  -- Would evaluate to 1.0 in the interpreter

/-- The golden ratio squared equals φ + 1. -/
lemma phi_squared : φ * φ = φ + 1 := by
  have := phi_fixed_point
  field_simp at this ⊢
  linarith
